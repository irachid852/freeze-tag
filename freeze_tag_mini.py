            An Optimal Algorithm for the Freeze-Tag Problem in 2D

    
    The algorithm is based on a talk I gave in November 2022 at the ANR meeting in Chasseneuil-du-Poitou, France. Slides are available on my webpage, or directly here https://dept-info.labri.fr/~gavoille/gavoille_publis.html#talk:Gav22. It is a tiny part (so called "_mini") of a larger set of programs I've developped during Spring 2022, and that has been used in the DISC'24 paper and also in its full version (https://dept-info.labri.fr/~gavoille/gavoille_publis.html#BCGH24). It uses dynamic programing, and its time complexity is 3^n, up to some polynomials. It is significantly faster than the naive (n/e)^(n+O(1)) like algorithms, testing all possible wake-up trees on n sleeping robots. The number A(n) of trees to be tested is n! times the number of non-planar (unordered) rooted binary trees on n nodes (each non leaf having 1 or 2 children). The number A(n) does not seem to be known from OEIS, but is clearly no more than C(n) = binom(2n,n)/(n+1), the n-th Catalan number.

    It works with any distance function, not only with the L2 norm. Because of the dynamic programing nature of the program, we use numbers of global variables. This is a bad programming technique, sorry for that, but it speeds up a lot the running time. In practice, on my laptop (MacBook Pro 2017), it takes about 1'35" for a set of 15 asleep robots, and 5'30" for 16 asleep robots, i.e., for 17 robots. Note that 17! = 355,687,428,096,000 ~ 4.1 days at 1 GHz. This confirms that the algorithm is significantly faster than n! or n^n. 
    
    Here is a short description of the (recursive) algorithm OPT(), for waking up any point set from any point r, and for any distance function dist(), which is not necessarily metric. We use OPT(r,A,b), which returns the optimal wake-up time for waking up the subset A of points from b‚àä{1,2} robots woken up and placed at r.

    For any point r, set A not containing r, and b‚àä{1,2}:

        OPT(r,A,b):
        | OPT(r,A,b) = 0, if |A| = 0
        | OPT(r,A,1) = min_{u‚àäA} { dist(r,u) + OPT(u,A\{u},2) }, if |A| > 0
        | OPT(r,A,2) = min_{A1,A2} max{ OPT(r,A1,1), OPT(r,A2,1) }

            where {A1,A2} is a partition of A. If dist() is metric, then we
            can force |A1|=0 => |A2|=1 (or the opposite) so that the nodes
            with only one child in the wake-up tree necessarily lead to a leaf.
            A distinction must then be made between the cases |A|=0, |A|=1, |A|>=2.

    The program is based on this formulation with some optimizations. It has been programmed under the Python 3.7.3 64-bits version.

DEFINITIONS & CONVENTIONS

What we call a ** rooted tree T ** is a simply a non empty list [ r, T_1, ..., T_k ] where r is the root of T and T_i is the i-th child of T, that is itself a rooted tree. So, for instance, [ r ] is a tree with only one node (the smallest possible tree), and [ r, [u], [v] ] is a tree with only two children (in this case, with the two leaves u and v). Note that a rooted tree has to contain at least one node, there is no special representation for an empty tree. A ** rooted tree T on a list P of points ** is simply a rooted tree whose vertices are indices of P, so integer in [0,|P|).

We reduce to the case where v falls within the first isosceles triangle by calculating arg(v)%(2ùúã/k). This vector is then projected onto the perpendicular bisector of the triangle using cos(t-arg(v)). Normalise the distance with the height of the triangle, which is cos(ùúã/k).

def generate_von_mises(n, p=0.5, k=1, f=0):

    Generate a list of n random points in the disc centred on the origin where the distance to the centre is x^p with x is uniform over [0,1] and where the angle follows a circular normal distribution (more precisely a von Mises distribution) of mean angle a_i = i*2ùúã/k where i is a uniform integer over [0,k[. We need k >= 1. The parameter f is related to the standard deviation of the angle from the direction with angle a_i. More precisely, the standard deviation is defined as sigma = (a_{i+1} - a_i)/(2f) = ùúã/(k*f). So the larger f is, the more angles are concentrated in a_i. We then arrange the standard deviation of the von Mises law so that it corresponds to sigma. To do this, we set the law parameter kappa = 1/sigma^2, which is a very good approximation (see https://dlwhittenbury.github.io/ds-1-sampling-and-visualising-the-von-mises-distribution.html).
    
    If p=0, then the distance is unitary and the points are all on the unit circle. If f=0, then the distribution of the angle will be uniform (infinite variance), whatever the value of k. If f=+‚àû (or any value of f<0), then the variance will be zero (kappa=+‚àû) and the possible angles will all be a_i. Set k=0 to indicate k=+‚àû, which will have a similar effect to setting f=0.
    
    Note that p=0.5 does not necessarily give a uniform distribution over the 'flower', i.e. the disc deformed by the k directions, especially when k is small and f is large enough.

    Examples:
    - generate_von_mises(n,0)        -> random pts uniformaly on the circle
    - generate_von_mises(n,0.5)      -> random pts uniformaly on the disk
    - generate_von_mises(n,1,k,-1)   -> random pts uniformaly on a star with k branchs
    - generate_von_mises(n,0.1,k,3)  -> random pts concentrate towards the k directions
    - generate_von_mises(n,-0.1,k,3) -> idem, but points are outside the circle

    Note that points are not necessarily ordered according to the angle at the origin. If you need this ordering, you need to proceed as follows:

        P = generate_von_mises(...)
        P.sort(key=lambda A:atan2(*A))

    If you need points that looks uniform on unit disc (or circle) w.r.t. some distance function d() that is not dist_L2(), you can proceed as follows:
    
        P = generate_von_mises(n,0.5) # replace 0.5 by 0 for the unit circle
        distortion(P,dist_L2,d)

    Construct a subset V of A without certain symmetries, (r,A) being an intance of the function opt(r,A,b). More precisely, let us denote D(i,j) the distance vector between i and all the points of A\{i,j}, ordered according to the increasing indices of A. We can calculate D(i,j) = [ dist(i,u) for u in A if u!=i and u!=j ].
    
    The subset V returned (actually a tuple) has the property that there are no i,j in V such that [ dist(r,i), D(i,j) ] = [ dist(r,j), D(j,i) ]. This is because the optimal trees for r -> i -> A\{i,j} and r -> j -> A\{i,j} will be identical. So either i or j can be deleted. This is linked to the fact that the distances between the points of A\{i,j} are the same for D(i,j) and D(j,i). Unfortunately, very few (r,A) instances have such symmetries. Even uniform points on a circle do not have these symmetries because the distances between points of index [1,2,3,4] for example, will not be the same from i or j, even if these 4 points are symmetrical around the origin. More symmetries internal to A\{i,j} should be taken into account.

def opt(r,A,b):
    """
    Returns the optimal wake-up time and tree for waking up the subset A (subset of POINTS indices) from 1 or 2 robots woken up and positioned at r (an index of POINTS). 
    If b=True, only 1 robot is awakened (and r has a single son in the tree), otherwise 2 are awakened (and r has two children). 
    The subset A must neither contain r nor be empty. We assume the metric case, i.e. DIST satisfies the triangle inequality.
    
    Be careful! A is here a tuple, not a list, so that it is 'hashable', which is important for @lru_cache(). 
    One property (which is not used) is that all calls to opt(r,A,b) are such that the indices of A are arranged in ascending order. 
    It can be shown that the complexity of opt(r,A,b), for a subset A of POINTS, is about O( |A|*|POINTS| * 2^|A| * binom(|POINTS|,|A|), up to some polynomials in |POINTS|.

    STRATEGY

        CASE 1 (b=True): choose the best target v in A, then wake up all the points of A\{v} with two robots placed at v by applying opt(v,A\{v},False and thus create a root tree r with a son, v, and its subtree.

        CASE 2 (b=False): cut A into two subsets, A1 and A2, each with at least one element, and apply the strategy opt(r,A1,True) and opt(r,A2,True) to create a tree rooted at r with two children. 
        Of course, all the partitions {A1,A2} must be tested and the best tree selected. 
        In the non-metric case, we would also have to test the case where a single robot moves to wake up the whole of A (A1=A and A2={}). 
        This is unnecessary in the metric case.
    
    For the complexity, that is exponetial in n, we will concentrate on the most important term: the exponent base of n. Let n=|POINTS|, a=|A|, and x = a/n. 
    We want to show that the time complexity C(a,n) = 2^a * binom(n,a) satisfies C(a,n) = O(3^n). If a = o(n), then clearly C(a,n) < 2^n. 
    It is well known that, for any constant ratio x = 0..1, binom(n,xn) ~ h(x)^n / ‚àö(2ùúãx(1-x)n) where h(x) = (1/x)^x * (1/(1-x))^(1-x). 
    As a result, C(xn,n) = 2^(xn) * binom(n,xn) ‚âÉ (2^x * h(x))^n. This is maximum whenever x=2/3. 
    In short, we can bound the complexity O( a*n * 2^n * binom(n,a) ) by O( n^{3/2} * 3^n ) (don't forget the 1/‚àön in binom(n,xn)). 
    Note that a log(n) term is probably missing accessing data in the cache (memorisation), although it is probably possible to implement it in O(1) time, at least in a damped way.

    NB. Care must be taken when managing lists and not to generate too many of them. Subsets could be coded as integers, perhaps to increase speed and make more efficient use of the cache. In any case, the presence of tuple(A)/list(A) in recursive calls is necessary to avoid the 'TypeError: unhashable type: ‚Äúlist‚Äù' error (you can't cache function calls that contain lists, but it's OK for tuples).

    # In this case, we need to divide A into two subsets, A1 and A2, each with at least 1 point, which is possible because here |A|>=2. To do this, we represent a subset of A by a binary word w of |A| bits. The 1 bits of w are the elements of A1, the 0 bits those not of A1 (thus of A2). We avoid w=000...00 and w=111...11 to guarantee |A1|,|A2|>=1. Since the {A1,A2} and {A2,A1} partitions produce an equivalent tree, we avoid the possibility of having A1 and then bar(A1), its complementary binary word. We can therefore assume that for A1, we go from w=000...01 to 011...11. Finally, we will guarantee that |A1|>=|A2| in order to cut faster (A1 being recursively launched before A2) because a priori it is for large sets that the tree has the best depth.
